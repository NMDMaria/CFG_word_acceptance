# Context free grammar language word acceptance
Using the CYK Algorithm with the representation I found on https://www.xarg.org/tools/cyk-algorithm/.

The input form is:
1. The non-terminal states of the CFG separated by space.
2. The terminals of the CFG separated by space.
3. The number of rules (if put in the same product rule with "|" then it counts as only one)
4. The start state.
5. Word to verify.
